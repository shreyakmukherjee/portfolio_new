    description:
      "This machine learning project performs sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews to classify them as positive or negative. It involves preprocessing the text data using NLP techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal. A Naive Bayes classifier is trained on the processed data to make predictions. The project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing can be used to extract insights from textual customer feedback.",
